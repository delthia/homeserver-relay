âš  This project is under construction. While the main functionallity of turning on and off the relay based on the time has been tested during a month, the script that makes the `avoid` functionallity to work is being worked on.

This project aims to replace the default firmware of a sonoff basic relay to make it automatically turn ond and off my homeserver, a raspberry pi.

Currently, this repo only holds the esphome script and the bash script that I'm working on to make this work completelly, and might not make much sense without its accompanying documentation, which should be pushed to the repo sometime in the near future.
